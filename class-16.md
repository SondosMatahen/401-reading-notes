## Event Driven Programming

- Nearly everything in the world is “Event Driven”

- Humans respond to events billions of times every day. Your eyes react to light. You hit the brakes when the car in front of you slows down. Your skin forms a blister when burned.

- Machines can be event driven as well. Self driving cars can stay in their lane by “reading” the road lines in real time. Thermostats constantly turn the heat/air on or off in response to the temperature.

- How can we leverage this in a software application?
  * Everything in JS is an object
  * Most actions in JS are event driven
  * UI Events
  * Express Routes
