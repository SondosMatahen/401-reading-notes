# Reading 36 - Redux

## Definition
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (It helps you write applications that behave consistently)

## Benifits
- In larger apps with a lot of moving pieces, state management becomes a huge concern. Redux ticks that off quite well without performance concerns or trading off testability.
- A lot of developers love Redux for the developer experience that comes with it.
- Using Redux you will get good features; include logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay — all without doing so much on your end as the developer.
