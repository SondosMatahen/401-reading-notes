***Measure twice and cut once***

1. Read the problem completely twice.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data:
    - Solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.
    - You could use a Mathematical Induction approach if possible. Using this approach uou might try and solve for 1 first, then for 2, then for n.
    - Also don’t forget to look for corner cases and edge cases and do any examples for those kind of cases you can think of.
    - Recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem. You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head. You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them.

3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6. Optimize the real code.

- What I took out from this article is that I should ask myself everytime I don't have enough time for something; who's in charge of my time? me or others? and according to the answer, I should reconsider my schedule. Also, I should be focused rather than just busy.

- What I think is also interesting is the idea which I believe in; that we shouldn't think less of ourselves and turn opportunities down because we think we are not capable of, if this opportunity fits my goals, go for it and we will improve ourselves in the process (the article didn't mention this idea exactly but reminded me of someone saying this in the same context), the problem is that the author encourage us to say no more, I know what's he is going for but I strongly disagree because in our age we shouldn't hesitate and accept everything because everything will somehow benifit us in the long run.

- Other than that, I thought the article's language was very harsh and overweening.  


## Article:  How to think like a programmer

- In order to have a better approach to porblem solving you have to :
  - Have a framework:
    1. Understand the problem.
    2. Plan the solution.
    3. Divide the problem, break it into sub-problems.
    4. If you're stuck after that: 
       - Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
       - Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
       - Research but don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. 
    5. Practice.
