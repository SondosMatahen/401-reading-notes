## Stacks and Queues

#### WHAT are stacks?
A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and. pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

#### WHY do we need stacks?
A stack is needed to implement depth-first search (an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures).

#### HOW to use stacks?
A stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list. 

#### EXTRA:
Stacks are based on the FILO and LIFO principles:  the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.

#### WHAT are queues?
A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

#### WHY do we need queues?
Queues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer. Another usage of queues is in the implementation of breadth-first search.

#### HOW to use queues?
Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes. Common implementations are circular buffers and linked lists.

#### EXTRA:
Queues are based on the LILO and FIFO principles:  the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list.
